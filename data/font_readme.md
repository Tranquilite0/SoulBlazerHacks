# Font Changes

* Added Font glyph for double quotes (the existing glyph appeared to be unused)
* Shifted double quotes up since they looked strange being so low.
* Added glyphs for left and right parentheses '(' and ')'
    * Existing glyphs in those slots were for `「` and  `」` and did not appear to be used in-game.
* Added the Archipelago logo (see APLogo-LICENCE.txt) to unused character glyphs in slots:
    * `$16`: AP Logo left
    * `$17`: AP Logo right
    * `$18`: AP Logo right (with up arrow)
